# Cognatus MCP Server Implementation Prompt

## AI Agent Task

Create an MCP server called **Cognatus** that implements the scientific method with sequential thinking capabilities for breakthrough research.

## Core Requirements

**Base Framework:** Extend the Sequential Thinking MCP Server architecture

**Primary Tool:** `scientific_thinking` with these stages:
- `observation` - Problem identification
- `literature_review` - Background research  
- `hypothesis_formation` - Generate testable hypotheses
- `experiment_design` - Design testing methodology
- `data_collection` - Gather evidence
- `analysis` - Analyze results
- `conclusion` - Draw conclusions and refine theory

**Additional Tools to Implement:**
- `hypothesis_generation` - Create multiple competing hypotheses
- `experiment_design` - Design systematic tests
- `literature_search` - Search academic databases
- `data_analysis` - Statistical analysis of results
- `peer_review_simulation` - Validate findings from multiple perspectives

## Key Features

- **Sequential Scientific Process:** Each stage builds on the previous one
- **Hypothesis Tracking:** Store and manage multiple hypotheses with evidence
- **Evidence Collection:** Systematically gather supporting/contradicting data
- **Breakthrough Detection:** Identify patterns and anomalies for novel discoveries
- **Multi-perspective Analysis:** Simulate peer review and alternative viewpoints

## Implementation Approach

1. **Start with Sequential Thinking base** - Use existing framework as foundation
2. **Add scientific method stages** - Implement the 7-stage research process
3. **Create hypothesis management** - Track multiple hypotheses with evidence scores
4. **Integrate research tools** - Add literature search, data analysis, and peer review
5. **Build breakthrough capabilities** - Pattern recognition and anomaly detection

## Success Criteria

The server should systematically approach research problems, generate testable hypotheses, design experiments, collect evidence, and arrive at validated conclusions through rigorous scientific methodology.

**Target:** Create an AI research system that can make breakthrough discoveries by following proper scientific method protocols.
